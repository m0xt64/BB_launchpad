# BB Launchpad Docs
This is an introduction into BB Launchpad dashboard. BB will have to determine, which stablecoins/originators/pools is gonna accept and launch for Smart Yield v2. 

Timeframe
Main TF is weekly. It doesn't include noise and daily spikes in volatility, but still provide sufficient information about the last activities. 
We show avg data of last month, which are then compared to avg data of previous month as well as to month half year ago. 
Display charts are 12months back with moving avg to get a better idea of trend. 

Supply
We are interested in seeing how big is the particular stablecoin in terms of supply = mcap. Eventhough Luna showed that higher mcap doesn't neccessarily mean lower risk but yet. It makes sense that we reflect the size and monitor the volatility. Obviously there are various types of stablecoins like overcollateralized or fiat backed, which have different pros and cons as well as scalling possibilites, but our aim is to be aware of their mcap changes. 

Volume
Volume is usually a good proxy of deep liquidity. We have to consider market cap vs volume ratio too. Generally speaking less volume while benchmark is increasing could result in less liquidity on DEXs which might cause cascade effect. 

Users
Rather than users who have ever touched any particular stablecoin, we care about "holders". People might interact with stablecoin w/o their awareness through any swaps or trades, therefore we rather monitor how many people hold this particular stablecoin. It can be again sensitive to market opportunities where users might deposit their stablecoins into some juicy farms etc.

Liquidity
Liquidity is hard to meassure because of efficiences of various DEXs. We are going to consider Curve and Uni v3 as those make most sense to have deep liquidity on. 

Performance
Price is the product. We want to give advantage to those who are successfuly holding the peg vs the ones who are constantly trading under/above the peg.
